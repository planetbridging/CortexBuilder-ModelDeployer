# Adaptive Hybrid Neural Network Framework (AHNNF)

AHNNF is an innovative approach to neural network architecture that combines elements of feedforward and recurrent neural networks, enabling dynamic adaptability and the potential for emergent temporal dynamics.

## Overview

The Adaptive Hybrid Neural Network Framework (AHNNF) is a unique micro-service-based AI system that introduces a flexible and dynamic neural network architecture. It allows neurons within hidden layers to form arbitrary connections with any other neurons in the network, including those from input and other hidden layers.
This flexible connectivity pattern, along with the ability to dynamically adapt the network's architecture through various mutation strategies, enables AHNNF to exhibit complex interaction patterns and capture temporal dependencies, while also optimizing its structure based on the task at hand.

## Key Functionality

- Feedforward Processing with Arbitrary Connections: AHNNF processes data in a layer-by-layer manner, similar to traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs). However, it allows neurons in hidden layers to connect to neurons from any other layers, introducing complex interaction patterns and potential feedback loops.
- Diverse Activation Functions: Neurons can utilize a wide range of activation functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, softmax, leaky ReLU, swish, ELU, SELU, and softplus, allowing for more nuanced and adaptable neuron behaviors.
- Dynamic Adaptability: AHNNF supports various mutation strategies, including weight and bias mutations, addition of new neurons and layers, and activation function mutations. These strategies are implemented in functions like randomizeWeightByActivationType, randomizeRandomNeuronBias, randomizeRandomNeuronActivationType, and addRandomNeuronToHiddenLayer.

## Potential Applications

- Sequence and Time-Series Data: With its ability to capture temporal dependencies through arbitrary connections, AHNNF could be applied to tasks involving sequence prediction, time-series analysis, and natural language processing.
- Complex Pattern Recognition: The flexible architecture makes it suitable for complex pattern recognition tasks where traditional fixed-topology networks might struggle.
- Adaptive Learning Systems: AHNNF's dynamic adaptability allows it to be used in systems that need to evolve and optimize their neural structures over time based on new data and changing requirements.
